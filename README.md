UTA Data Bootcamp Challenge 14

The "Belly Button Challenge" involved diplaying data concerning microbes found in the human navel.  
This challenge required us to use JavaScript to display the data in an interactive way.
We used D3 to bring in JSON data from a website, and then constructed interactive
bar charts and bubble charts that were controlled from a dropdown menu.
The dropdown also displayed metadata for the individual sample.

The website I used for my static page is
